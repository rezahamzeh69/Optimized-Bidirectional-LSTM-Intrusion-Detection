# Optimized-Bidirectional-LSTM-Intrusion-Detection
By incorporating advanced steps such as hyperparameter tuning (via Keras Tuner), class balancing with SMOTE, and threshold tuning based on the F1-Score, this code provides a robust and optimized framework for training a Bidirectional LSTM for classification tasks like network intrusion detection. Although these additional processes increase the execution time compared to a fixed-architecture approach, they significantly enhance model performance and accuracyâ€”making the extra computational cost worthwhile for critical applications.
